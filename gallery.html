      <u><b>Karunaratne relieved by scrappy Sri Lanka win</b></u></br>
      Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne was relieved to see his team return to winning ways at the Cricket World Cup.

An opening-match thrashing at the hands of New Zealand left Sri Lanka with plenty to prove and they made a meal at times of seeing off Afghanistan on Tuesday.

But the result was the primary objective and Sri Lanka won, if only by 34 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method.

Their innings of 201 all out in drizzly Cardiff was a missed opportunity to put together a big score, after cruising to 144-1 by early in the 22nd over.

The collapse gave Afghanistan a glimmer of hope, and briefly the underdogs had a shot at reaching their modest target, which was revised to 187, only to slump from 121-5 to 152 all out.

"I think we had such a good start. But suddenly we lost a couple of wickets," Karunaratne said at the post-match presentations. "That's the negative side on our part ... but otherwise the bowling and fielding was a high note.

"After losing the first game which was not easy we had to keep our minds positive.

"We have experience in these conditions. We lost against New Zealand and then we knew what we had to do here. We started really well and the only thing is we needed to capitalise in the middle part."

      Sri-Lanka have undoubtedly have had a rough start to their asia cup and WT20 Campaign. 
      After having lost all their practice matches Sri-Lanka may have some pressure on their shoulders if the Solid 4 do not fire.
      Afghanistan on the other hand will take their chances winning the qualifiers comprehensively.Look out for this cracker of a match.

              <u><b>The Downfall Of Sri Lanka Cricket</b></u></br>
              All good things come to an end and it was proved by the downfall of Sri Lanka cricket. From having world class players 
              like Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya playing in one team to having only Angelo Mathews and 
              Lasith Malinga in the team who can be classified as world class, the downfall of Sri Lanka cricket is really baffling.

                <u><b>PAK v SL 2019: Sri Lanka players arrive in Pakistan to play first Test after a decade</b></u></br>
                The Sri Lankan team is all set to play two Tests in Pakistan as Dimuth Karunaratne & Co. landed in Pakistan.
                After a successful ODI and T20I series against a second-string Sri Lankan side, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) managed 
                to convince the senior Sri Lankan cricketers to play the Test series this month. With the first Test starting in Rawalpindi 
                in a couple of days’ time, the visitors have arrived and marked the day as a very happy one for the PCB office bearers.
                PCB chairman Ehsan Mani said, “It’s a huge day for all the Pakistanis and we have been waiting for this day for quite some time. 
                It will send a strong message to the whole cricketing world that Pakistan has the ability to host all its home matches in Pakistan.”
                If the first Test starts as planned, it will be the first Test match in the country after a decade. The Pakistan government has 
                promised top-level security, which is reserved for heads of states, to the players. Also, there will be 4,000 troops deployed around 
                the stadium during the tenure of the game.
