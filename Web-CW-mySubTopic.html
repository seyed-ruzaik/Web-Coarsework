	<h2 id = "year">1975-1987 – White Jerseys</h2>
	<img src = "images/1.png"  align = "left">
	<p>Players wore white jerseys in the first 4 World Cups. The “coloured jerseys” first featured in a World Cup in 1992.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">1992 – Light Blue</h2>
	<img src = "images/2.png"  align = "left">
	<p>Countries were allowed to wear coloured jerseys for the first time in World Cups in 1992 and every country had to 
	follow the same template with different colours pertaining to their nation.Sri Lanka were in light blue (Sapphire Blue)
	under the captaincy of Aravinda De Silva in Australia & New Zealand.The tournament wasn’t a good one for the island as they
	lost 5 of the 8 matches in the first round.But the 92’ Sri Lankan team put a record win against Zimbabwe (becoming the first
	team to chase 300+ in ODIs) to make the jersey a memorable souvenir.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">1996 – Blue with yellow stripes</h2>
	<img src = "images/3.png"  align = "left">
	<p>The historic year of 1996, the Lankan World Cup jersey were again under the same concept as 1992 – Same design with 
	relevant colours to represent each individual country.Sri Lanka rocked a navy-blue kit under the leadership of Arjuna Ranatunga
	who eventually guided Sri Lanka to the championship.They wore it with pride back in 1996 and made sure that pride will prevail
	in the years to come with their historic win for all of Sri Lanka.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">1999 – Regal Lion</h2>
	<img src = "images/4.png"  align = "left">
	<p>The 1999 World Cup will not be remembered well among Sri Lankans for their team’s performances but will hold its own with 
	the jersey they wore.What you see is a full blown lion in the major part of the jersey just like the flag of Sri Lanka. 
	Unfortunately, we were deprived of seeing this jersey more as Sri Lanka couldn’t go past the group stage in this tournament.
	The kit will be remembered as the last national colours (in ODIs) under the greatest captain Sri Lanka has ever produced;
	Arjuna Ranatunga.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">2003 – Plain Blue/Yellow Jersey</h2>
	<img src = "images/5.png"  align = "left">
	<p>The 2003 World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe & Kenya is where Sri Lanka found their groove again in World Tournaments.
	Since then, Sri Lanka has never failed to make it into the knock out stages at the World Cup.A Sanath Jayasuriya led Sri Lankan
	team were lucky enough to wear the signature blue/yellow jersey which we last saw in the semifinal versus Australia where Aravinda
	de Silva retired from the profession.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">2007 – Blue Lion</h2>
	<img src = "images/6.png"  align = "left">
	<p>The 2007 Caribbean World Cup was one of the most memorable tournaments Sri Lanka ever had; so is its jersey. This was a favorite 
	national jersey among all the jerseys and the team have done justice for the design by becoming the runners-up of the tournament,
	losing the final to the mighty Australians.Lasith Malinga’s 4 in 4, Sanath Jayasuriya’s brutal centuries, Muttaih Muralitharan’s 
	crafty bowling and Mahela Jayawardene’s magical innings in the semifinal have made this jersey an all-star exhibit.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">2011 – Plain Blue/Yellow Jersey</h2>
	<img src = "images/7.png"  align = "left">
	<p>This one almost made it happen for Sri Lanka; Every Sri Lankan dreamt of Kumar Sangakkara wearing this jersey and lifting that
	prestigious trophy above his head on April 01st 2015, the day before the final.This jersey was featured in 9 matches and only 2 
	losses including the World Cup final at Wankhede stadium.This kit will always be honored as the last Sri Lankan colours on legendary
	spin master, Muttiah Muralitharan.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">2015 – A Lion on Shoulder</h2>
	<img src = "images/8.png"  align = "left">
	<p>The 2015 World Cup jersey was one of the most futuristic designs a Sri Lankan side ever wore. Angelo Mathews was the lucky chap
	to guide the team with different shades of blue on his chest in Australia and New Zealand.The team wore this for 7 matches and lost
	3 of them including the encounters against the eventual finalists of the tournament. The journey ended in the quarter final match 
	versus South Africa.This kit will be always remembered for Kumar Sangakkara’s four consecutive centuries.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "container">
	<h2 id = "year">2019 – The Turtle, Sea and the Beach</h2>
	<img src = "images/9.png"  align = "left">
	<p>For 2019, The national Sri Lankan Jersey was made from recycled plastic sea waste from the Sri Lankan coast with the help of the 
	Sri Lankan Navy to drive an important concept of environmental conservation.The design includes three turtles in sea (Light blue) 
	heading to the beach (Yellow) to raise awareness of the fight against ocean pollution. The jersey looks glamorous as ever.The Lion 
	is placed on the shoulder just like 2015 one. With luck on their side, fans will get to see their team wearing this proudly on July 
	14 at Lord’s with the Trophy in their hands.</p>
